## Setting up a product ready Kubernetes cluster
You can follow [this guild](https://github.com/kenphunggg/kubespray.git) to build your own K8s cluster using `Kubespray`

## Setting up a serverless cluster
In this testbed, we're using [Knative](https://knative.dev/docs/) for building a `Serverless cluster`

### Prerequisite
It is recommended to using [Metallb](https://metallb.io/) to expose a IPV4 address for cluster's `Loadbalancer` Service

#### 1. Preparation
If youâ€™re using kube-proxy in IPVS mode, since Kubernetes v1.14.2 you have to enable strict ARP mode.

You can achieve this by editing kube-proxy config in current cluster:

```shell
# see what changes would be made, returns nonzero returncode if different
kubectl get configmap kube-proxy -n kube-system -o yaml | \
sed -e "s/strictARP: false/strictARP: true/" | \
kubectl diff -f - -n kube-system

# actually apply the changes, returns nonzero returncode on errors only
kubectl get configmap kube-proxy -n kube-system -o yaml | \
sed -e "s/strictARP: false/strictARP: true/" | \
kubectl apply -f - -n kube-system
```

#### 2. Installation by manifest
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.15.2/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```

#### 3. Configuration
In order to assign an IP to the services, MetalLB must be instructed to do so via the `IPAddressPool` CR.

All the IPs allocated via `IPAddressPools` contribute to the pool of IPs that MetalLB uses to assign IPs to services.

```shell
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: first-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - <Your ipaddresspool>  # Example: 192.168.122.1-192.168.122.250
```

### Installing Knative Serving using YAML files

#### 1. Install the Knative Serving component

To install the Knative Serving component:

```shell
# Install the required custom resources by running the command
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/knative-v1.18.1/serving-crds.yaml

# Install the core components of Knative Serving by running the command
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/knative-v1.18.1/serving-core.yaml
```

#### 2. Install a networking layer

```shell
# Install the Knative Kourier controller by running the command
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/knative/net-kourier/releases/download/knative-v1.18.0/kourier.yaml

# Configure Knative Serving to use Kourier by default by running the command:
kubectl patch configmap/config-network \
  --namespace knative-serving \
  --type merge \
  --patch '{"data":{"ingress-class":"kourier.ingress.networking.knative.dev"}}'
```

Fetch the External IP address or CNAME by running the command:

```shell
kubectl --namespace kourier-system get service kourier
```

#### 3. Verify the installation

Monitor the Knative components until all of the components show a STATUS of Running or Completed. You can do this by running the following command and inspecting the output:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n knative-serving
```

Example output:

```shell
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
3scale-kourier-control-54cc54cc58-mmdgq   1/1     Running   0          81s
activator-67656dcbbb-8mftq                1/1     Running   0          97s
autoscaler-df6856b64-5h4lc                1/1     Running   0          97s
controller-788796f49d-4x6pm               1/1     Running   0          97s
webhook-859796bc7-8n5g2                   1/1     Running   0          96s
```

#### 4. Configure DNS

You can configure DNS to prevent the need to run curl commands with a host header.

Knative provides a Kubernetes Job called default-domain that configures Knative Serving to use sslip.io as the default DNS suffix.

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/knative-v1.18.1/serving-default-domain.yaml
```
